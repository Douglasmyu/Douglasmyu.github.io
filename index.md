## Favorite CPSC 120 Labs

* Lab 2, part 1

    Lab 2, part 1 was one of my favorites because growning up, I always loved making madlibs.  I was able to write functions that took in strings and made them into pre-written sentences.  

* Lab 4, part 1

    Lab 4, part 1 was one of my favorites because I was curious about unit conversions.  I was able to write functions to convert TSP to TBSP. I liked how it also showed other unit conversions from mL input.

* Lab 6, part 2

    Lab 6, part 2 was one of my favorites because I love the game blackjack.  I was able to write functions that calculate the different pairs of cards.  Although it is not real blackjack, it can help inexperienced players calculate their cards.
